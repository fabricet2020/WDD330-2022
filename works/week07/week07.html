               <h3>Ch 11: Further Functions</h3>
               <p>functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around in the same way as every
                 other value.
                 They can have their own properties and methods.</p>
               <ul>

                 <li>All functions share some built-in methods: length() and call()</li>
                 <li>Functions can have custom properties. For example: square.properties = "This is a customer property
                   description"</li>
                 <li>Custom properties provide Memoization. Memoization is a useful feature that provides result caching
                 </li>
                 <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function
                   that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined.</li>
                 <li>IIFEs are a useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope
                   of the function. This means the global namespace is not polluted with lots of variable names.</li>
                 <li>IIFEs are useful for temp variable handling and initialization code (code that is there to
                   initialize and won't be used anywhere again)</li>
                 <li>The recommended way of using STRICT MODE is to place it inside an IIFE, because other people may
                   not be using STRICT MODE. This ensures that only our code is in strict mode</li>
                 <li>IIFEs can be used to self-contain blocks of code to ensure that they don't mess with each other and
                   for testing purposes</li>
                 <li>JS functions can also define and rewrite themselves by calling themselves inside the function. Note
                   that previously set properties of a function will be lost if this is done.</li>
                 <li>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful
                   tool to use when iterative processes are involved. For example a factorial function.</li>
                 <li>A PROMISE represents the future result of an asynchronous operation.</li>
                 <li>A promise is created using a constructor function. This takes a function called an EXECUTOR as an
                   argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts the asynchronous operation.
                   It also accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve() function is called if the operation is
                   successful, and the reject() function is called if the operation fails.</li>
                 <p>Pure Functions:A key aspect of functional programming is its use of pure functions. A pure function
                   is a function that adheres to the following rules:</p>
                 <ol>
                   <li>The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. It
                     doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.</li>
                   <li>There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the
                     program.
                     It only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values, rather than altering any
                     of the underlying data.</li>
                   <li>Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always return the same
                     result.</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>In order to follow these rules, any pure function must have:</p>
                 <p>At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on something other than the arguments
                   of the function, breaking the first rule
                   A return value; otherwise there’s no point in the function (unless it has changed something else in
                   the program – in which case, it’s broken the 'no side-effects' rule).</p>



                 <li>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another
                   function as a result, or both.</li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Ch 13: AJAX</h3>
               <ul>
                 <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it
                   dynamically updates web pages without reloading.
                   This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be
                   updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</li>
                 <li>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources
                   requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</li>
                 <li>An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access
                   to another program or service. Many websites allow controlled access to their data via public APIs.
                   This means that developers are able to interact with the data and create mashups of third-party
                   services.</li>
                 <li>FETCH API is the living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network
                 </li>
                 <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the
                   URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</li>
                 <li>Fetch API has a response interface. Response objects have a number of properties and methods that
                   allow us to process the response effectively. Some properties are .headers, .url, .redirected, .type
                 </li>
                 <li>Redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL in the response interface. Note: no
                   browser supports this currently</li>
                 <li>The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns
                   a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</li>
                 <li>The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet. Once it
                   has read the whole file, it returns a promise that resolves with a blob object.</li>
                 <li>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with
                   these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
                 <li>We can also create our own response objects . "const response = new Response(...). These can be
                   useful to use if you are creating an API that needs to send a response, or if you need to send a
                   dummy response for testing purposes.</li>
                 <li>FETCH API also has a Request interface. We can get more fine-grained control over the request being
                   made by providing a Request object as an argument. </li>
                 <li>Request objects are created using the Request() constructor, and include the following properties:
                   url, method, headers, mode, cache, credentials, redirect</li>
                 <li>FETCH API has a Headers Interface. HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information
                   about a request or response. Typical information contained in headers includes the file-type of the
                   resource,
                   cookie information, authentication information and when the resource was last modified.The Fetch API
                   introduced a Headers interface, which can be used to create a Headers object, which can then be added
                   as a property of Request and Response objects.</li>
                 <li>A new Headers instance is created using a constructor function: "const headers = new Headers();"
                 </li>
                 <li>Header's object has the following properties and methods: has(), get(), set(), append(), delete(),
                   and so forth.</li>
                 <li>FETCH API also has a FormData interface which makes it easier to submit information in forms using
                   Ajax</li>
                 <li>A FormData instance is created using a constructor function: "const data = new FormData();"</li>
                 <li>NOTE: the Fetch API is still in development but current versions are supported in most major
                   browsers. jQuery is an alternative, because it has a built-in method called ajax() that functions
                   similar to the Fetch API.</li>
