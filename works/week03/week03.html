          <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
          <p>this is a keyword whose value changes depending on how a function gets called.
            There six different ways where this can take on new values: in global context
            in object construction, in an object method, in a simple function, in an arrow function,
            in an event listener </p>
          <p>Summary</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Example: user.sayHi(). So, here we’ve got a method sayHi of the object user.</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming is the act of writing our code using objects to represent entities</li>
            <li>If you need this to reference the object in an event listener, you need to use bind to manually create a
              this context.
              bind is a method that is present in every function. It allows you to change the this context.
            </li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
          <p>An object is a self-contained set of related values and functions and
            act as a collection of named properties that map to any JS value (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and
            functions).
            If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. Eg. const spiderman = {};</li>
            <li>To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation.</li>
            <li>A constructor function is used to create a new date object using the new operator:
              const today = new Date();</li>
            <li>JSON is often used to exchange information between web services, and is employed by sites such as
              Twitter, Facebook and Trello to share information</li>
            <li>The Math object is a built-in object that has several properties representing mathematical constants.
            </li>
            <li>A constructor function is used to create a new date object using the new operator.</li>
            <li>In a regular expression, there are a number of characters that have a special meaning, commonly known as
              metacharacters</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 6: Document Object Model</h3>
          <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the
            page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even
            altering how they are styled.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The getElementById() method does exactly what it says on the tin.
              It returns a reference to the element with a unique id attribute that is given as an argument.</li>
            <li>getElementsByClassName() will return a live node list of all elements that have the class name that is
              supplied as an argument.</li>
            <li>The setAttribute can change the value of an element’s attributes.</li>
            <li>createElement() method that takes a tag name as a parameter and returns that element</li>
            <li>The innerHTML returns all the child elements of an element as a string of HTML.</li>
            <li>A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 7: Events</h3>
          <p>Are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called.
              This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the
              event</li>
            <li>Coordinates of an Event:
              There are a variety of ways to find the position of where a mouse event occurs.</li>
            <li>We have already seen the click event that occurs when a mouse button is clicked. There are also the
              mousedown and mouseup events. These both occur before a click event is fired.</li>
            <li>Event propagation is the order that the events fire on each element. There are two forms of event
              propagation: bubbling and capturing.</li>

          </ul>

            <b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b>
            <br>
            I have updated my CSS file and so much time spent in reading. I also had the opportunity to manipulate
            plainty of exercises online related to this week's reading.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What am I going to do next?</b>
            <br>
            More reading to assimulate the lessons together with more exercises.   
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What are my blockers?</b>
            <br>
            I felt like getting tired and need to take a full day break using a laptop. Less sleep and my eyes are getting swollen
            because of the hours I am spending infront of the laptop. But this will come to pass.
