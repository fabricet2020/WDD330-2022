          <h3>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
          <p>Summary</p>
          <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
              interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as
              a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Exceptions</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with
              the error. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Stack Traces</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Warnings</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
            </li>
            <li>Note that not all browsers will display a warning for the code</li>
            <li>When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the JavaScript code will
              stop working in the background</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>

            <li>Strict mode is the norm for programming. To use, include this in the first line: 'use strict'; </li>
            <li>Linting Tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, ES Lint help with coding convention</li>
            <li>Feature Detection: Feature detection guarantees that the method is only
              called if it actually exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being
              thrown, if the method doesn’t exist.</li>
            <li>Feature Detection can also detect browser support.</li>
            <li>Alert() can be used for debugging with breakpoints</li>
            <li>"debugger" command is useful! Learn to use it better.</li>
            <li>Error Objects: We can create objects to show different types of errors.</li>
            <li>Types of Error Objects: Error(), EvalError(), RangeError(), ReferenceError(), SyntaxError(),
              TypeError(),
              URIError(), InternalError()</li>
            <li>Throwing Exceptions: Use "throw" to highlight problems in code. It will top the execution.</li>
            <li>The best practice is to throw an error object. "throw new Error('...')</li>
            <li>Try, catch, AND finally: Used to catch any errors but not halt the program. It will let us know in
              the background what the exceptions are.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Red-Green-Refactor:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
            <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
            <li>Refactor the code</li>
            <li>Test refactored code</li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            <br>
          </ol>

          <li>Testing Frameworks: They provide methods that make creating tests easier.</li>
          <li>Jest is a testing framework developed by Facebook tp do such things.</li>

            <b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b>
            <br>
            This past week I started with the design of my Todo Application using the local storage method. Although I
            do feel like I can finish it this week, I still need some reading to understand perfectly the topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What am I going to do next?</b>
            <br>
            My next move is to finalize the Todo list assignment that responds to the specifications; to insert task,
            view, and delete.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What are my blockers?</b>
            <br>
            My blocker this week was my job's project that required me to travel to areas weak with an internet
            connection. but luckily I had done some readings and tasks way before I traveled. </p>
