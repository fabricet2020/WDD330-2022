          <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
          <p>Summary</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Buttons trigger events in our web pages. Carefully selecting the correct use of them such as the reset
              (clear) button that is not advisable since they can wipe out all the data that was entered.</li>
            <li>Within your HTML tags, attributes such as: </li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hidden:</strong> used in the text field tags and will hide the entire field when the page is
                displayed by the browser. Usually, this technique is used to provide a value or some settings that are
                already available. Since these types of info are in no way secret, they shouldn’t be used for sensitive
                data.</li>
              <li><strong>Password:</strong> is used to convert a word, number, or characters into character * thus
                hiding the typed information</li>
              <li><strong>Number:</strong> will force the keyboard to only accept numbers except for the letter e or E
                for exponential</li>
            </ul>
            <li>To avoid saving inconsistent or empty data to the database, a developer must apply the techniques of
              validation. For example, when a field is left empty or inconsistent is typed, the browser must respond to
              the user to attend to the compulsory field before saving data. In some cases, the submit button must be
              disabled until all fields are correctly completed.</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 12: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript</h3>
          <p>OOP has three main concepts in OOP: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong> In this method, the end-user (usually without programming knowledge) can
              only see the essential functionalities such as the fields and buttons; but the programming logic is all
              written inside an object.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> allow programmers to use the same process/method for different objects.
              This method also allows the object to override share methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong>Inheritance: This process allows an object to use another object’s features
              by inheriting all its properties and methods and adding some new features if possible (using the prototype
              property of that object’s class).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Library such as jQuery, Underscore & Lodash is used to complete common tasks without having to use lots
              of repetitive code. The most advantage of using a library is that it will be used by lots of people and
              thoroughly tested while its main disadvantage is the application tends to slow down.</li>
            <li><strong>MVC Frameworks:</strong> Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a programming design used by server-side
              frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django. Recently, it has been used in JavaScript to organize
              large-scale web applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Models:</strong> Models are ways for implementing the CRUD operations (creating, reading,
              updating, and deleting). For example, dynamic navigation will request that all views (pages) access the
              database items from a single controller so that when the database is manipulated, the navigation bar reads
              the data accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Views:</strong> Throughout the browser, views provide a visual representation of the model
              showing all the relevant information and also provide a way for users to interact with an application,
              usually via forms</li>
            <li><strong>Controllers:</strong> are create links between models and views together by communicating
              between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a
              form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly.</li>
          </ul>

        <button class="accordion">Weekly Report</button>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            <b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b>
            <br>
            Read, read, and read again! These readings were very crucial a professional way to splitting files and link
            them across a web development project.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What am I going to do next?</b>
            <br>
            My plan is to apply the MVC framework method by creating models, views, and controllers for my website.
            This way, I will be able to practice deeply what I have learned.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What are my blockers?</b>
            <br>
            Taking five courses in one semester is not easy but it is manageable. Without a schedule, I was running up
            and
            down without prioritizing my weekly tasks and also fall behind with my assignments
            but thanks to a colleague’s good counsel, I managed to fix my timetable.
