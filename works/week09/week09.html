          <h3>Ch 9: The Window Object</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Window Object: In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
            <li>Browser Object Model: a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
            <li>To access the BOM, we use the window object to access the properties and methods</li>
            <li>Global variables are properties of the global object. They are created without the use of const, let, or var.</li>
            <li>The window object has some dialog methods: window.alert(), window.confirm(), window.prompt()</li>
            <li>Document object: the window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
            <li>Document.write(): Writes a string of text to the page. It will replace whatever html was there.</li>
            <li>Cookies: Cookies are used to store data about the user for the site. Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons.</li>      
          </ul>

          <h3>Ch 14: HTML5 APIs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML5 Web Storage: The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is
              similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is
              generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users,
              as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during
              future sessions.</li>
            <li>If Web storage is not supported by the browser then the window object has the "localStorage" property</li>
            <li>There is also sessionStorage, which works the same as a php session</li>
            <li>Every time a value is saved to localStorage, a storage event is fired.</li>
            <li>We can use JSON.stringify() to store any JS object in local storage</li>
            <li>Geolocation API: used to obtain the geographical position of the device.
              This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby
              places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can
              then be used to filter data based on the user’s location or speed and direction of
              travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on
              your location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be
              granted by the user first.</li>
            <li>To use this API, we use the navigator object in combination with the getCurrentPosition() method</li>
            <li>For example: "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);"</li>
            <li>youAreHere is a position object with a coords property with a latitude and longitude</li>
          </ul>

 <!--          <h3>Web Storage API Crucial Differences</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
            <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the
              domain is the same).</li>
            <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies</li>
            <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This
              potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup
              once a day.</li>
            <li>Web Workers:Web workers allow processes to be run
              in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is that
              any processes that could take a long time are carried out in the background, so a
              website will continue to function without fear of the dreaded “script has become
              unresponsive” message that occurs when a script runs for too long,</li>
            <li>To use, use the Worker() constructor function to create a new worker. (const worker = new Worker('task.js');)</li>
            <li>Websockets:Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server –
              also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and
              responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</li>
            <li>Notifications API: The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s
              notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes
              depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system notification
              is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn’t the
              current tab.</li>

            <b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b>
            <br>
            Catching up on my classwork. I have done a lot of reading as well on APIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What am I going to do next?</b>
            <br>
            Create a plan for my final project. Considering all the modules that will form part of my Web project. 
            And then create a clear milestone.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What are my blockers?</b>
            <br>
            Understanding APIs was a little bit hard since my previous Web Fundamentals course proved to be 
            difficult. My team is also lacking in meeting effectively besides texting each other.
