        <h2>WEEK 02 - SUBMISSION</h2>

        <button class="accordion">Reading notes</button>
        <div class="panel">

          <p>This week's reading has been very interesting. The use of Array and functions really helped me understand
            how to store multiple values of the same data type.</p>
          <p>I had three chapters to focus on:</p>

          <h3>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h3>
          <p>Programming has evolved from each generation of computers. The computer programs are categorized as
            low-level programming language that consists of machine code and assembly language. These types of
            programming languages are somewhat difficult to manipulate thus the invention of High-level programming
            languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, or PHP; these programs may use natural human language.</p>
          <p>Few details about programming:</p>

          <ul>

            <li>JavaScript needs only a text editor and a web browser</li>
            <li>JavaScript was originally called Mocha, but it was changed to LiveScript, then hastily rebranded as
              JavaScript</li>
            <li>All programming languages have a list of Reserved Words</li>
            <li>JavaScript has two types of comments. Single line comments starting with // and Multi-line comments
              starting with /*and finishing with */</li>
            <li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with the C
              programming language.</li>
            <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types: String, Symbol, Number,
              Boolean, Undefined, Null</li>
            <li>Variables must be declared before being used. The keyword const is used when the variable is not
              reassigned to another value, whereas let is used if the variable reassignment will take place.</li>
            <li>A variable can either have a local scope (will only be available inside that block and not be accessible
              outside of that block) or global scope (accessible everywhere in the program).</li>
            <li>JS support arithmetic and logical operators</li>
            <li>Variable values can be changed using increment or decrement operator</li>
            <li>Type coercion happens when the operands of an operator are of different types.</li>
            <li>The best way to change a string to a number is to use the Number method, parseInt(), or parseFloat()
            </li>
            <li>The preferred way of changing a number to a string is to use the String function or toString()</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 3:Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>As an ordered list of values, Array syntax can be written as follow:</li>
            literal: const myArray = [];
            constructor: const myArray = new Array()
            <li>Both produce an empty array, but it’s preferable to use array literals (require less typing).</li>
            <li>An empty array literal is called heroes</li>
            <li>Operations available with: pop(), push(), shift(), concat(), join(), slice(), splice(), reverse(),
              sort(),
              indexof(), includes(),unshift(), add(), delete(), set(), has(), includes()… for example, the delete
              operator will remove an item from an array</li>
            <li>A Multidimensional Array is an array of arrays</li>
            <li>Maps is a data structure as a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs. They are similar
              to 'hashes', 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries'.</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter 4:Functions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A function is a chunk of code and in JavaScript, they are considered to be first-class objects</li>
            <li>Function Expression assigns an anonymous function to a variable</li>
            <li>A function can also be declared using the constructor Function(). In this way, the body of the function
              is entered as a string.</li>
            <li>Parameters and arguments represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle
              difference though any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is
              invoked, it is provided with arguments.</li>
            <li>ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring functions called the arrow These make declaring functions much
              more succinct by using less verbose syntax.</li>
            <li>If the function doesn't require any parameters, a pair of empty parentheses must go before the arrow.
            </li>
            <li>Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations to the
              top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined. Functions that are defined using a
              function declaration are automatically hoisted, meaning they can be invoked before they have been defined.
            </li>
            <li>A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</li>

          </ul>

        <div class="panel">

            <b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b>
            <br>
            I have tried implementing arrays and functions in my scripts to create some reasonable programming logic.
            The reading was intense and I have decided to read again for more understanding. I have tested some CSS
            capability using JS instead. For example function myFunction() { document.body.style.backgroundColor =
            "red";} which will set the background color to red. Also, I have updated some of my links.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What am I going to do next?</b>
            <br>
            I still feel like I need more reading of the function chapter and work on my web pages by updating the page
            contents.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What are my blockers?</b>
            <br>
            I am becoming my own problem. At some point, I feel like the website (as hosted) doesn’t look as beautiful
            as I need and that I should redo it. But looking at the time and other courses that I have taken this
            semester, I will rather work with it and keep on updating it a little here and there.
